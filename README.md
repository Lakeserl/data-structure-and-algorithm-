# data-structure-and-algorithm

## Introduction

This repository is created for my own use to practice and improve my algorithmic problem-solving skills. Feel free to explore the problems, solutions, and resources available here.

## Getting Started

1. Explore Problem Sets: Browse through the problem sets organized by topics and difficulty levels.
2. Choose a Problem: Select a problem that interests you or matches your current skill level.
3. Implement Solutions: Implement your solution to the selected problem in your preferred programming language.
4. Compare Solutions: Compare your solution with the provided solutions to learn different approaches and techniques.
5. Track Progress: Keep track of your progress as you solve more problems and improve your skills.
6. Contribute: If you have additional problems, solutions, or improvements to existing content, feel free to contribute.

## Daily Updates

I will update this fucking repository every day until completion. Stay tuned for new content and improvements!

## Languages

I plan to use different programming languages for each topic to broaden my knowledge and understanding of different languages. Here's how I intend to use them:

- Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python will be my choice for topics such as dynamic programming and graph algorithms.
- C++: With its high performance and low-level control, I'll use C++ for topics requiring efficiency, such as binary search and heap data structures.


## IDE

For optimal coding experience, consider using the following IDEs:

- **Python**: Visual Studio Code: [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - Extensions:Python,Python Test Explorer, Python snippets
- **C++**: CLions: [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)


## Contents

- Problem Sets: Organized by topics such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.
